# i2c_rtdm
This is a Xenomai RTDM driver for i2c controller in beagle bone black. This RTDM is tested with a i2c BMP085 sensor application. Any problems with this RTDM driver are welcomed I would try to solve them.

Before using it Please try to contact me at jaikothari10@gmail.com . There are some settings required which I would suggest. 

Thank You
